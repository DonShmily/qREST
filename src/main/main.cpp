** qREST is a long-term vibration monitoring system for single buildings,
** which consists of sensors, data collectors, transmission lines, local
** terminals, remote information platforms and data processing and analysis
** software. At the time of earthquake, the system can quickly assess the
** safety status of the building and record the seismic response of the
** structure within minutes, which not only provides the basis for
** earthquake emergency management, but also provides the data basis for
** further analysis and assessment of the earthquake-damaged building; at
** normal times, the system can assess the safety status of the structure
** through real-time monitoring of the building's dynamic characteristics
** and other state parameters.
